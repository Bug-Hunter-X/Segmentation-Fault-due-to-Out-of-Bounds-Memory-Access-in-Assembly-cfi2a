mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10].  The problem arises if the sum of ebx, (ecx*4), and 0x10 results in a memory address outside the bounds of allocated memory or falls within a protected memory region. This leads to a segmentation fault or access violation.
